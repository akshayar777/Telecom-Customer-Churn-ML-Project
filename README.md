# Telecom-Customer-Churn-ML-Project


##Objective

The telecommunications industry is essential for global connectivity, enabling communication through voice, data, and internet services. In this highly competitive market, retaining customers is critical for telecom companies to maintain profitability and market share. Data science has become an indispensable tool in the telecommunications sector, allowing companies to analyze vast amounts of customer data to understand behavior, identify trends, and predict outcomes such as customer churn. By taking advantage of machine learning, telecom companies can proactively address potential churn, improving customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Customer churn is one of the biggest costs for any organization. Also known as customer turnover, it is the percentage of customers who stop using your company's product or service within a certain period of time.

In this project, we aim to find out the key indicators of churn and retention strategies that can be implemented to avoid the problem of a customer leaving the organization.
